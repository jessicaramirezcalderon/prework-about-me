      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a Senior Web Producer for Scientific American Magazine. 
      I have a BA in Politics (and Theology lol, don't ask) from Fordham 
      University and I started my career as a journalist. I have worked for Telemundo, 
      NY1 News and Bill Moyers, prior to SciAm.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Dominican Republic.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Binge watching the same shows repeatedly.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Big Boss Tech Lady at a major newspaper. I'm not ready to give up media/news yet.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Jersey.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Money. No, seriously. I have been flirting with tech for years
        and given my current role, it really makes sense for me to finally make
        the transition to development. We could use another hand at work. 
        Fortunately, I have a very supportive team that will allow me to begin
        working as soon as I'm ready.
